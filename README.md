# Difference Calculator
A difference calculator is a program that determines the difference between two data structures. This is a popular task, for which there are many online services, for example: http://www.jsondiff.com/. A similar mechanism is used when outputting tests or automatically tracking changes in configuration files.
Utility features:
- Supports different input formats: "yaml" and "json".
- Generating a report in the form of "plain text", "stylish" and "json".
